## How it was built (Or you can call this Technologies Used)

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery to build this game.

## How to play / Features

There is only one known move to beat the computer!

The game will track the number of games both you and the CPU has won. The board resets automatically after 1,5 sec. I added a reset button to clear the score board.
