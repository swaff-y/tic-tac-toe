# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a project to create a tic-tac-toe game that allows you to see if you can beat the computer.

## How it was built

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, odometer.js and jQuery to build this game.

## How to play / Features

There is only one known move to beat the computer! This is so that I can display how the game works.

The game will track the number of games both you and the CPU has won. The board resets automatically after 1,5 sec. I added a reset button to clear the score board.

## Known Bugs
Best played on a desktop with a mouse. Does not play as well on a mobile device.


## Future feature / Wishlist

- change x and o icons (I was soo close)
- change icons to pictures (did not get started)
